These cache files were taken from running the script
cdash_analyze_and_report.py for the Specialized ATDM Trilinos Builds
Cleanup set for the testing day 2018-10-28.  We keep that date in these files
because some of the tests require the detailed test history and there are
computations on the date.  Therefore, to make it easy to use this data we keep
the date 2018-10-28.

The ATDM Trilinos failures for this test day will therefore be immortalized
and live on for many years!
